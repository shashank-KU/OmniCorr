### Reproducibility and raw data processing

The example datasets included in `data/` (salmon multi-omics data) are derived
from raw sequencing and count data using documented preprocessing workflows.

All scripts and raw inputs used to generate these datasets are provided in the
`raw-data/` directory. These include normalization, filtering, and
WGCNA-based feature clustering steps and are supplied for transparency and
reproducibility.
