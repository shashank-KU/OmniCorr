\title{OmniCorr: Multi-omics Integration and Visualization Framework}
\description{
OmniCorr is an R package-style framework for correlation-based integration and visualization of multi-omics datasets, including transcriptomics, metatranscriptomics, metagenomics, metaproteomics, and associated sample metadata. The package computes pairwise correlations between independently processed omics layers and provides flexible tools for organizing and visualizing cross-omics associations using aligned heatmaps and optional network-style visualizations. OmniCorr is designed to complement existing preprocessing and network inference workflows rather than replace them.
