# Case Study 2: Cattle (Rumen) Multi-Omics Analysis

This directory contains **supplementary case studies** demonstrating the application
of OmniCorr and related multi-omics methods to a cattle (rumen) dataset.

---

## Folder overview

### `Cattle_OmniCorr/`

This folder demonstrates the use of **OmniCorr** on the cattle (rumen) multi-omics dataset.

It includes:
- Preprocessed multi-omics input data
- OmniCorr correlation analysis
- Identification of key modules associated with phenotypes
- Export of selected objects for downstream functional analysis

Key scripts:
- `Rumen_OmniCorr.Rmd`  
  Runs OmniCorr on rumen transcriptomics, metagenomics, and metadata.
- `for_kegg_inputs.RData`  
  Saved R objects required for downstream KEGG enrichment (see below).

Example (from the workflow):
```r
# Save objects for downstream analysis
save(
  Archbac.modules, Ciliates.modules, Fungi.modules, 
  Metazoa.modules, MetL.modules, MetW.modules,
  meta,
  result_pheno_L, result_pheno_W, result3, result3.1, result3.2,
  key_modules,
  file = "OmniCorr_light/for_kegg_inputs.RData"
)
```

### `Cattle_MOFA/`

This folder contains a **parallel multi-omics analysis using MOFA** on the same cattle (rumen) dataset.

The purpose of this analysis is to:

- Support **methodological comparison** discussed in the manuscript  
- Illustrate differences between:
  - **Correlation-based integration** (OmniCorr)
  - **Latent-factor-based integration** (MOFA)

The MOFA workflow is **independent of OmniCorr** and does **not rely on OmniCorr functions**.  
It is included solely for comparison and contextualization.

## Downstream functional analysis (KEGG)

Some scripts in this case study perform **KEGG pathway enrichment analysis** using objects
generated by the OmniCorr workflow.

🔒 **KEGG licensing notice**

- KEGG pathway annotations are subject to licensing restrictions  
- Raw KEGG databases and annotation files are **not included** in this repository  
- Users must obtain KEGG annotations independently

To ensure reproducibility **without redistributing restricted resources**, only:
- summarized results, and  
- example data structures  

are shown in this repository.

Prepared objects for KEGG analysis can be loaded using:

```r
load("OmniCorr_light/for_kegg_inputs.RData")
