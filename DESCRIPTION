Description: OmniCorr is an R package-style framework for correlation-based
    integration and visualization of multi-omics datasets, including
    transcriptomics, metatranscriptomics, metagenomics, metaproteomics,
    and associated sample metadata. The package computes pairwise correlations
    between independently processed omics layers and provides flexible tools
    for organizing and visualizing cross-omics associations using aligned
    heatmaps and optional network-style visualizations. OmniCorr is designed
    to complement existing preprocessing and network inference workflows
    rather than replace them.
